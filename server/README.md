# BeeyondWords API

This API accesses a database of words and their corresponding properties. All content was generated by Chat-GPT and may contain errors or irregularities.

## Access

In order to access results from protected endpoints, an authorization header must be sent with the request.

All endpoints are available for GET requests only.

[Click Here](mailto:dev.by.hutch@gmail.com) to send an email requesting access and instructions.

## Results format

Responses are formatted as JSON.

The structure of each word is an object with the following properties: 

```json
{
  "_id": String,
  "word": String,
  "part_of_speech": String,
  "definition": String,
  "etymology": String,
  "example_sentence": String,
  "synonyms": [up to four synonyms, empty array if none available],
  "antonyms": [up to four antonyms, empty array if none available],
  "gradeLevel": Number
}
```

If the endpoint you call can return multiple results, results will be stored in an array, even if there is only one matching result.

```json
[
  {first word},
  {second word},
  {third word}
]
```
